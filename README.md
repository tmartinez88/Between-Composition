# Objectives and Understanding
Through various historic cases, we will attempt to achieve a general understanding of how technological and cultural developments influence musical practices or give rise to new ones. With this in mind we hope to develop seeds for our own development of practices in sound or other mediums that are experimental, new, and draw from outside influences. We will gain familiarity with some basic tools for audio work and look at new technologies that are not inherently musical and explore ways they might be used in a sonic context. 

# Introductions 
Ask ourselves, how does music or sound relate to your life or personal practice? What interested you in taking the course? 

# Core Concepts - Thesis
Between Composition was originally conceived of through an invitation to participate in The Fruits of the Pluralist workshop series curated by Angie Meitzler at Pioneer Works. The core concept behind the workshop series was to explore technological systems that draw on and recognize a plurality of identities and forms of communication centered in spatiality and non-binary complexity. Beyond flirting with my love for spatial audio, the prompt and invitation energized my excitement in a text I had read almost a decade before, Noise by Jeacque Atali. Noise framed the development of contemporary western music in a sociological context- using historic developments in the political and technological sphere to elucidate concurrent shifts in the musical one- and vice versa. I thought that this observation spoke well to the theme of the workshop series, encouraging a way of thinking that saw boundaries between forms of expression more as a mushy

# About the Tools
A little about PureData. It’s an open source tool developed by Miller Pucket from the Music Department at UCSD. It’s an easy to use, visually appealing, free software that many composers use to develop algorithms for sound and music. It also lets you connect sensors and other types of input data to it in order to control parameters. PureData is embeddable in websites, mobile devices, as well as our personal computers which makes it a great tool for making audio programs that can be distributed easily. 

Audacity is a Digital Audio Workstation or DAW for short. Other DAW’s you might have heard of are ProTools, Ableton, Logic, or GarageBand. Audacity is a free software that is light and great for sequencing or editing audio. It’s even great for adding cool effects.

# Workshop 1 hour (Hands On PureData Development and Play)
In this GitHub you will find the PureData “patch” we will be building. We can think of a patch as a program - or an app. We’ll refer to the little boxes in the patch as “objects”, they’re connected by “patch cables”. Each object handles a specific task or function. Object boxes are containers of code that the developer has written. We connect these objects together to create our program. You can build programs in PureData to perform millions of different tasks- but it’s designed with musical and compositional tasks in mind. The patch below, and that we will be building together, will allow us to perform a networked spatial composition as a group. We’ll choose a partner in the class and trigger sounds from across the room. We’ll also define some “rules” for our sound piece a la Deep Listening methods.  


# Hands On Portion
 Design Patch
    Question: What other parameters might we need?
Cut Sound Samples (Time Permitting)
Pair Off
Get your partners IP address
Establish Trust (Create a gate to prevent incoming connections)
Test

# Play 
How do we organize our sound? 
Create a fluxus sound piece that uses our network patch and orchestra of laptops
How could this look in writing? How could it look visually? 
Rework this John Teske Graphic Score using our new software. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE7wrqxK-Ks
Reflection
How did it make us feel. Did we like the sounds. Politics of managing this piece together. 

 
# Fruits of the Pluralist is a program series that explores technological systems and practices that recognize many different kinds of identities, structures, and forms of communication. The series will showcase workshops and activations centered in spatiality and non-binary complexity.
